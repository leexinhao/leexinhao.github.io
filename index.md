## Research Interests

My research interests lies at the computer vision and multimodal:

- Multimodal Instruction-following Agents
- Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning
- Vision-language representation learning
- Vision Foundation Models

I am particularly interested in the progress of the above direction in the field of **video understanding**. Currently, I am researching how to utilize pre-trained language models for creating multimodal instruction-following agents that can understand videos excellently.
