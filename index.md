## Research Interests

My research interests lies at the computer vision and multimodal:

- Vision-Language Representation Learning
- Vision Foundation Models
- Multimodal Instruction-following Agents
- Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning


I am particularly interested in the progress of the above direction in the field of **video understanding**. Currently, I am researching how to build and evaluate the long video mllms & video foundation models.
