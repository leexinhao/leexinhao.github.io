> Nice to meet you !!!😊

I am a MS student 🙂 at **Nanjing University** (2023.09—2026.06 if everything goes as expected), supervised by Prof. [*<font color="#006ab1">Limin Wang</font>*](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=HEuN8PcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Previously, I received a bachelor degree from **Chongqing University** in 2023.06 (Major in computer science and technology 🖥️, GPA: 3.9/4.0 overall rank: 1/295). I am also working as a research intern in [<font color="#006ab1">Shanghai AI lab</font>](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) (2023.07—present). Before that, I worked as an intern in [<font color="#006ab1">SenseTime</font>](https://www.sensetime.com) (2022.10—2023.06).

## Research Interests

My research interests lies at the computer vision and multimodal:

- Vision-Language Representation Learning
- Vision Foundation Models
- Multimodal Instruction-following Agents
- Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning


I am particularly interested in the progress of the above direction in the field of **video understanding**. Currently, I am researching how to build and evaluate the long video mllms.
 <!-- Additionally, I am researching how to utilize pre-trained language models for creating multimodal instruction-following agents that can understand videos excellently. -->
