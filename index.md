## Research Interests

My research interests lies at the computer vision and multimodal:

- Vision-Language Representation Learning
- Vision Foundation Models
- Multimodal Instruction-following Agents
- Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning


I am particularly interested in the progress of the above direction in the field of **video understanding**. Currently, I am researching large-scale video-text pre-training and the establishment of video foundation models.
 <!-- Additionally, I am researching how to utilize pre-trained language models for creating multimodal instruction-following agents that can understand videos excellently. -->
